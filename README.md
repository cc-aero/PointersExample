# PointersExample
##### A C++ Example demonstrating the concept of pointers
This repo is much simpler than my ContactsApp modularity example as I feel that there's
a bit less to demonstrate.

## Pointers
Pointers in C++ are defined like this:
```c++
int pointToThis;
int* intPointer = &pointToThis; 
```
